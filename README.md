Working

The Company Diary system works by providing a centralized platform for placement officers to manage and track all company-related information. When a company expresses interest in recruiting, its details are entered into the system. Follow-up communications are logged and updated as interactions progress.

Placement officers can schedule and record recruitment drives, track student participation, and update hiring results. The system automatically organizes data to generate analytical reports, helping staff make data-driven decisions about upcoming placement activities.

The interface provides an easy navigation flow:

Login to the system using admin credentials.

Access the dashboard to view summary statistics.

Manage company entries, follow-ups, and recruitment results.

Generate reports for departmental submission or record maintenance.

By digitizing manual processes, Company Diary significantly reduces paperwork and improves efficiency in managing placement activities.
